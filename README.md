# BUTTON-ONE
A game made for the 1-Button game jam.

Plan:
Fall as long as possible, score increase with distance

the button is when you click (or space). If you tap it, you are propelled back a bit
(slow down)
Make sure the slow down is ONLY enough to combat gravity. Don't want people going up
instead of down.

If you hold the button, you CHARGE {<- theme} downward.
[OPT] ->
you have a charge gauge which fills up over time. You use this when charging.
To make charging worth it, you destroy obstacles in your path.

There are asteroids (and probably a variety of other obstacles like ufos & aliens)
that will destroy your ship.
Don't forget frogs!

for added difficulty if there is more time, maybe add things that move player from
center as obstacle.
EX: UFO beam pulls player to one of the sides and just makes it harder for them.

Linear difficulty curve?

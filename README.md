# BUTTON-ONE
A game made for the 1-Button game jam.

The goal of the game is to avoid asteroids while falling through space.
By clicking, tapping, or pressing space, your spaceship will bounce, allowing
you to dodge various obstacles. The farther down you travel, the greater
the score.

Made with Godot 4.
